Design goals Ideas / Notes / Updates

Origin Idea -

Create a price comparison tool and add a simple GUI

Familirize with new languages tools outside of current wheelhouse

	Create comparison tool with python for linux

	Use amazon (and potentially additional sites if time provides)



Used tools -

	Python Selenium webdrivers would work well with desired goals.

	ToDo - Find python GUI



Change of plans - 

	Trying to learn a brand new language proved to diffucult. Selenium is nice and simple, but a lack of understanding of basic python infestructure is turning
	mountains to mole hills 
	try with java

	

Java web tools:

		Jaunt, HTMLUnit, JSoup, Jauntium, Selenium

	Had minor success with Jaunt, Jauntium
	
	Moving back to Selenium. More comfrotable 

Graphic tools:

	JFX, Swing, NetBeans
Swing: Simple, easy to use, very basic (and a little ugly)
JFX: Slightly more complicated, prettier


Selenium design:

	Selenium solidified as best choice, swing used for basic GUI

	Xpath usage: Easier to move Up / Down ancestors for elements. Use as much as possible
